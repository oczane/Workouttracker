WorkoutTracker
==============

Sample Rest App in Node.JS, Express.JS, MongoDB (using mongoose connector) and Angular.JS

Make sure, you have installed Node.JS and "npm" is working.

Install Express using npm install -g express-generator@4 to make Express globally.

Fork the "WorkoutTracker" app or download it.

run npm install (yes. just like Rails bundle installs)

run mongoDB locally using mongod <your path>

run node app (or app.js) from your command prompt. (app runs on 3000. You can configure, any port you wish to)

just point to http://127.0.0.1:3000

Full stack is running.
